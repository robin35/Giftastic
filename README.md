Thank you for visiting my repository. This project displays TV show Gifs from https://giphy.com. 

Here’s how it works:

    Initial Load:
    	When the web page loads, it is pre-populated with 8 differnt TV show buttons.
    	If the user clicks on one of the 8 buttons, it will execute an API call to giphy.com for 10 Gifs related to the TV show.
    	The 10 Gifs related to that show's buton will display in the "TV monitor" in the lower half of the screen.  
    	If the 10 Gifs overflow the "TV monitor", a scroll bar will appear to the right and the user can scroll through the Gifs with a mouse or via touch screen.

    Adding Buttons:
    	The user also has the ability to add buttons of their favorite TV show.  
    	To add a show, type the name in the search box and click submit.  A button will then be created and displayed at the beginning of inital buttons.  
    	Click the new button to execue an API call to giphy.com to display 10 gifs.
    
    Animate the Gifs:
    	The Gifs will be loaded as stills.
    	Click once on the Gif to animate it.
    	Click on the Gif again to toggle back to still.
    
This project is for everyone.

Hope you enjoy the Gifs!
